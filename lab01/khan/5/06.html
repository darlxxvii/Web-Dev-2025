        <p> Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl<br>
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there <br>
She would merengue and do the cha-cha<br>
And while she tried to be a star<br>
Tony always tended bar<br>
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4<br>
They were young and they had each other<br>
Who could ask for more?<br>

[Chorus:]<br>
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)<br>
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)<br>
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana<br><br>
Music and passion were always the fashion<br>
At the copa.... they fell in love</p>
